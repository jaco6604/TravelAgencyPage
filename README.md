\# Travel Agency Page



A simple HTML website I made to showcase guided tours in the city of Tokyo, Japan.



\## Features

-Guided tour package overviews (group and private travel)

-Highlights of the top itineraries with images for Shinjuku City, Shibuya and Taito City.

-The use of semantic HTML for clear structure (`<h1>`,`<h2>`,`<ul>`,`<figure>`,`<figcaption>`).

-For the sake of convenience external links open in a new tab. 



\## What I Learned

-How to structure a webpage with semantic HTML for readability.

-How to include images and captions by using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`.

-How to use `<a>` tags with `target="\_blank"` to open links in new tabs.

-How to organize content to provide an easy to use and clean layout.
